Within this repository, a trio of meticulously fine-tuned models for binary software requirements classification are presented. These models categorize requirements into functional (F) and non-functional (NF) domains.

## [KM45L6V2OC](https://github.com/kasrahabib/software-re-classifier/tree/main/f_nf_classifier_model/KM45L6V2OC) Model: 

This model is meticulously trained on an amalgamation of SWARD subsets, namely publicly disclosed and non-disclosed requirements. Its utilization is recommended across the board. The model's training dataset comprises 9,647 instances, and its evaluation dataset encompasses 2,412 instances. For more comprehensive explanations and guidance on performance, and code usage, please navigate to the model directory.
