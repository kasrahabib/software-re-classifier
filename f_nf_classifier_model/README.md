Within this repository, a trio of meticulously fine-tuned models for binary software requirements classification are presented. These models categorize requirements into functional (F) and non-functional (NF) domains.

## [KM45L6V2OC](https://github.com/kasrahabib/software-re-classifier/tree/main/f_nf_classifier_model/KM45L6V2OC) Model: 

This model is meticulously trained on an amalgamation of SWARD subsets, namely publicly disclosed and non-disclosed requirements. Its utilization is recommended across the board. The model's training dataset comprises 9,647 instances, and its evaluation dataset encompasses 2,412 instances. For further explanations, performance usage guide navigate into model directory.

## [KM45L6V2TOTC](https://github.com/kasrahabib/software-re-classifier/tree/main/f_nf_classifier_model/KM45L6V2TOTC) Model: 
Trained exclusively on publicly disclosed software requirements, this model is devised for evaluation on the non-disclosed subset of SWARD, serving as a case study. Its application is contingent upon the nature of the project. With a training dataset encompassing 9,270 instances, its evaluation dataset comprises 2,789 instances.

## [KM45L6V2TCTO](https://github.com/kasrahabib/software-re-classifier/tree/main/f_nf_classifier_model/KM45L6V2TCTO) Model: 

This model, trained on non-disclosed requirements, is evaluated on the publicly disclosed subset of SWARD, thereby constituting another case study. Its recommendation for use aligns with the project's specific context. The model's training dataset encompasses 2,798 instances, while its evaluation dataset comprises 9,270 instances.
