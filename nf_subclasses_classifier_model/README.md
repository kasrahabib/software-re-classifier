Within this repository, a trio of meticulously fine-tuned models for binary software requirements classification are presented. These models categorize requirements into functional (F) and non-functional (NF) domains.

## [KM35NCDF](https://github.com/kasrahabib/software-re-classifier/tree/main/nf_subclasses_classifier_model/KM35NCDF) Model: 

This model is meticulously trained using Software Requirements Dataset (SWARD) for classifying 19 Non-functional requirements. Note that based on literature, two out of 19 classes are Data and Behavior, belong to types of Functional software requirements. For more comprehensive explanations and guidance on performance, and code usage, please navigate to the model directory.
